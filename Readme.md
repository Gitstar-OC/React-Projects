## Big Projects
**_These are some huge projects that I have created (No one is full-stack currently). These projects encompass all the React concepts that I have mentioned in [React Notes](https://github.com/Gitstar-OC/React-Notes). The code for these projects is stored in separate repositories so I can update them as needed. You can also make pull requests if you want to contribute, and I will review your changes._**

## Mini Projects

**_These are some extremely useful lines of code which may be asked in interviews and might be helpful concepts. You can modify them further to the next level using your ideas and coding abilities. I am just providing basic code for each particular topic._**

<a name="accordian"></a>
- 1. [Accordian Component](projects/src/Accordian/Accordian.jsx) (<50 loc) 
   - This is a button which, on click, opens multiple divs or components, and if the button is not enabled, you can only see one component or div at a time!
   > #### _**`useState Hook, Coping State, Map Method, Push and Splice`**_

<a name="rcg"></a>
- 2. [Random Color Generator](projects/src/RCG.jsx) (<60 loc)
   - This is a page that, on click of the "Generate Random Color" button, generates a random color which can be chosen accordingly like "RGB" or "HEX" color.
   > #### _**`useEffect, useState Hook, For-Loop`**_
