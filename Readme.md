## Big Projects
**_These are some huge projects that I have created (No one is full-stack currently). These projects encompass all the React concepts that I have mentioned in [React Notes](https://github.com/Gitstar-OC/React-Notes). The code for these projects is stored in separate repositories so I can update them as needed. You can also make pull requests if you want to contribute, and I will review your changes._**

- ### 1. [Little Lemon Coursera](https://github.com/Gitstar-OC/Little-Lemon-Coursera)
  > <details> The Capstone project at the center of this course is based on a scenario involving the restaurant Little Lemon. In particular, the owners of Little Lemon have received negative feedback on the reserve a table function on the Little Lemon website. Users are confused about how to use it and unhappy with how it looks and functions. I had build a responsive web app and demonstrate multiple skills by coding a modern front end application that allows users to reserve a table for the Little Lemon restaurant. </details>

- ### 2. [Theme-Verse (In Progress...)](https://github.com/Gitstar-OC/Theme-Verse)
  > <details> This is a platform that offers customizable themes for the primary sections of your homepage, tailored to your preferences. Various leading technologies are used in this project with some css libraries like Tailwind and Bootstrap, JavaScript libraries like React and Chakra UI. I will be adding a page that will be used to show the websites that I have built from a figma file and add a path to it. </details>

## Mini Projects

**_These are some extremely useful lines of code which may be asked in interviews and might be helpful concepts. You can modify them further to the next level using your ideas and coding abilities. I am just providing basic code for each particular topic._**

- #### 1. [Accordian Component](projects/src/Accordian/Accordian.jsx) (<50 loc) 
   - This is a button which, on click, opens multiple divs or components, and if the button is not enabled, you can only see one component or div at a time!
   > #### _**`useState Hook, Coping State, Map Method, Push and Splice`**_

<a name="rcg"></a>
- #### 2. [Random Color Generator](projects/src/RCG.jsx) (<60 loc)

   > #### _**`useEffect, useState Hook, For-Loop`**_
